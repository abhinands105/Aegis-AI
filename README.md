# 🛡️ Aegis-AI – Adaptive Gameplay Integrity System

**Goal:**  
Detect and prevent cheating in **PUBG/BGMI** by analyzing player behavior patterns, visual gameplay data, and physical inputs in **real-time** using adaptive AI models that learn new cheat behaviors **within hours, not weeks**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Behavior AI** – Tracks impossible gameplay patterns over time.
- **Vision AI** – Analyzes what the player actually sees to detect ESP/wallhacks.
- **Input AI** – Detects script-like mouse/touch precision and abnormal click timing.
- **Federated Learning** – Learns from multiple devices without sending raw gameplay data.
- **GAN-Style Training** – AI learns to detect evolving cheats using synthetic “cheater bots”.

## 🔄 Pipeline Overview

1. **Data Collection**
   - Normal data from esports matches, verified pros, and volunteers.
   - Cheating data from controlled test accounts with aimbot, wallhack, recoil scripts, and speedhack.
   - Supplementary ban video datasets + Kaggle PUBG anomalies.

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - **Gameplay Stats**: kill/move ratio anomalies, recoil deviation, headshot %, reaction time.
   - **Vision AI**: visibility vs. kill timing, crosshair snapping, aim travel speed.
   - **Input AI**: touch/mouse smoothness, DPI & acceleration, click timing consistency.

3. **Model Architecture**
   - Multi-Modal Transformer (MMT) with:
     - LSTM/Transformer branch for gameplay time-series.
     - Vision Transformer (ViT) branch for replay/frame analysis.
     - CNN branch for input device patterns.
   - Fusion Layer → Cheat Probability Score.

4. **Training Strategy**
   - Semi-supervised learning with labeled & unlabeled matches.
   - GAN-style adversarial simulation.
   - Federated updates without raw data sharing.

5. **Deployment**
   - **Client-Side Lite AI** for instant flags.
   - **Server-Side Heavy AI** for final verification & ban decisions.
   - Moderator Dashboard for cheat probability & replay highlights.
